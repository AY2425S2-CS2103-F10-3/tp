### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tuitionbook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tuitionbook/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tuitionbook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tuitionbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tuitionbook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tuitionbook/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tuitionbook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.tuitionbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

###  Adding/Removing lessons feature

#### Implementation - Parsers

As for parsing the commands entered by the user, there is the `LessonAddCommandParser` and `LessonDeleteCommandParser`.
They are used to extract the lesson information provided, along with the index of the contact to operate on.

Both Parser Commands perform the key steps during execution:

- Tokenise the user's input suing `ArgumentTokenizer`, which splits the index and arguments by `PREFIX_LESSON`
- Index of person to operate on is determined with `ParserUtil#parseIndex`, and throws a `ParseException` if the index is invalid.
- Checks that `PREFIX_LESSON` exists using `arePrefixesPresent` implemented by the parsers.
- Parses the lessons into `Lesson` objects using `ParserUtil#parseLessons`, and throws a `ParseException` if the lesson details provided are incorrect.
- Returns a constructed `LessonAddCommand` or `LessonDeleteCommand` with the parsed index and lessons list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the parsers (`LessonAddCommandParser` and `LessonDeleteCommandParser`) attempts to parse the user's input:

![LessonAddDeleteCommandParserActivityDiagram.png](images/LessonAddDeleteCommandParserActivityDiagram.png)

#### Implementation - Commands

The lesson adding and removing feature is implemented by the `LessonAddCommand` and `LessonDeleteCommand` classes.
They are used to add or remove lessons of a contact in TuitionBook, based on the index specified by the user.

Both commands perform the following key steps during execution:

- Validate that INDEX is within the bounds of the filtered persons list `model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
- Check for duplicate lessons provided by the user after parsing
  - Duplicates existing within 2 different users is detected using `Model#hasLesson(List<Lesson>)`
  - Duplicates existing within the command is detected with a hashmap of lesson timings
- Perform the action on the person
  - In `LessonAddCommand`, the existing and new lessons are combined using `Stream.concat`
  - In `LessonDeleteCommand`, the lessons to delete are removed from the existing lessons using Streams filter.
- Updating the person using `createEditedPerson` method implemented by both commands, which creates a new Person with updated lessons.
- TuitionBook is then updated using `Model#setPerson` to update the model with the new person, and the UI is refreshed using `Model#updateFilteredPersonList`.
- Returns a constructed `CommandResult` with success messages and details of lessons added/removed.

The following diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `LessonAddCommand`:

![LessonAddCommandActivityDiagram.png](images/LessonAddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `LessonDeleteCommand`:

![LessonDeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png](images/LessonDeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how a lesson-add operation goes through the `Logic` component:

The following sequence diagram shows how a lesson-delete operation goes through the `Logic` component:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* is a private tuition teacher
* has a need to manage a significant number of student/parent contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Provide fast access to student/parent contact details as well as their learning progress (Subjects or Modules taken, Year of study and upcoming lesson timings), optimized for users who prefer a CLI.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
         **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

   1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-3/tp/releases).

   1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TuitionBook.

   1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tuitionbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
      A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data and the window size may not be optimum.<br>
      ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by running the `java -jar tuitionbook.jar` command again.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

3. Shutdown

    1. Enter the `exit` command to close the application.



### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing data files

   1. From the initial sample data, run a command to initiate a save to the data file and close the application.

   1. Delete the data file and re-launch the application.<br>
      Expected: TuitionBook will restart with the sample data.

1. Dealing with corrupted data files

   1. From the initial sample data, run a command to initiate a save to the data file and close the application.

   1. Modify any contact to have the same name and/or lesson with another contact in the data file and re-launch the application.<br>
      Expected: TuitionBook will start with empty data. The data file will only update after a save has been initiated.
